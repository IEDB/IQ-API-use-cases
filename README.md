# IEDB Query API (IQ-API) use cases

This repository contains several use cases that demonstrate various functionalities of the [IEDB Query API (IQ-API)](https://query-api.iedb.org/docs/swagger).  It is not very thorough or organized, but the hope is that will improve in the future.  Currently, it is divided into use cases worked out in [Python](python) (using Jupyter) and [R](R) (using RMarkdown).  Each use case includes the code (.ipynb files for Python and .Rmd files for R) as well as rendered HTML files.

If you are just getting started with IQ-API, you will want to start with [Use Case 1A](python/use_case_1a.html), as it introduces some of the very basics.

Keep in mind that the IEDB is very active, so query results will vary over time and will not necessarily match exactly those that are in each of the use cases.

If there are other use cases of interest that are not yet available here, please send an email to [help@iedb.org](mailto:help@iedb.org).
